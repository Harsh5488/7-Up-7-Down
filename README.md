# 7-Up-7-Down
A fun game of guessing the number, written in C language only.<br/>
I have used the CodeBlocks IDE for writing the code.

## Instruction
You just have to guess the sum of the numbers on two dices (rolled simultaneously).<br/>
The Home screen has the instruction in detail.

## Screenshots
If your guess if correct then, it's a +1.<br/>

Else, it yields -1.<br/>
